            HTML and CSS are both wonderful languages, of which you can create you very own webpages!<br>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
            On this webpage, you will learn the basics of HTML and basic CSS selectors.

        <!--Basic HTML tags-->
        <h3>Basic HTML tags</h3>
        <h4>Note: You do have to include the less than signs and the greater than signs at the front and back of each tag, even the closing tags.</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li> "h1" through "h6" tags. These 6 tags require a closing tags(ex. /h1). They are basic headings, which get bigger, or are more important the smaller the number inside the tag.</li>
            <li> The "div" tag. This tag requires a closing tag. This tag helps cover an certain amount of space, mainly used to apply style to a high amount of space.</li>
            <li> The "p" tag. You need a closing p tag to use this tag. P stands for paragraph, so text inside this tag will be in paragraph format.</li>
            <li> To add links to your code, you require an "a" tag. You need a closing tag for this. All text inside the closing tag will becone a link. But what link? To specify what link, inside the starting a tag, put a space and type href = "". Inside the quotation marks type your link. Done!</li>
            <li> To make lists, add either an "ol" or an "ul" tag with the closing tags. OL is ordered list and ul is unordered list. Add an "li" tag with closing tag and all the text inside the "li" tags will become a list item.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Those are some of the basic HTML tags that will be vital in the creation of webpages. There is also the "script" tag, which you can put JS inside, but that is more advanced.</h3><br>
        <h3>Basic CSS Selectors</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li> The element selector. It is very simple. Inside the style tags, you just write which element, a set of curly braces, and the information inside the curly braces.</li>
            <li> The id selector. To create an id, just put a "#" and after that, you write the name of the id, curly braces, as always, and the info.</li>
            <li> The class selector. To create a class, just put a "." before the name of the class. Then curly braces, then info. Classes and id's do the same thing, but you can't use an id more than once. That's why we have classes.</li>
